# Predicting-House-Price-Kaggle-Competition
Founded in 2010, Kaggle is a Data Science platform where users can share, collaborate, and compete. One key feature of Kaggle is “Competitions”, which offers users the ability to practice on real-world data and to test their skills with, and against, an international community.

This guide will teach you how to approach and enter a Kaggle competition, including exploring the data, creating and engineering features, building models, and submitting predictions. We’ll use Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook.



The Competition
We’ll work through the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition.

We’ll follow these steps to a successful Kaggle Competition submission:

Acquire the data
Explore the data
Engineer and transform the features and the target variable
Build a model
Make and submit predictions
Step 1: Acquire the data and create our environment
We need to acquire the data for the competition. The descriptions of the features and some other helpful information are contained in a file with an obvious name, data_description.txt.

Download the data and save it into a folder where you’ll keep everything you need for the competition.

We will first look at the train.csv data. After we’ve trained a model, we’ll make predictions using the test.csv data.
